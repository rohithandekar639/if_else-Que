#22. Implement a program to determine the type of a triangle based on its angles


angle1 = int(input("Enter the first angle "))
angle2 = int(input("Enter the second angle "))
angle3 = int(input("Enter the third angle "))

if angle1 == angle2 == angle3 == 60:
    angle ="Eqilateral Triangle"
elif angle1 == angle2 or angle1 == angle3 or angle2 ==angle3:
    angle ="Isosceles"
else :
    angle ="scalene"

print(f"the triangle is {angle} triagle based on its angle" )
