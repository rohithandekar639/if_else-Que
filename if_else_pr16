#16. Develop a program that determines the type of angle based on its measure (acute, obtuse, or right).

angle = float(input("Enter a angle"))

if angle < 90 :
    print("the angle is acute angle")

elif angle > 90 :
    print("the angle is obtuse angle")
else :
    print("the angle is right angle")
